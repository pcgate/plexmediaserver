        <h1>Streaming Quality Settings How To Use</h1>
        <p><b>Transcoder quality</b>
        </p>
        <p>Transcoding is the proces by which the content you have imported into your Plex Media Server is streamed to another device. When a file is transcoded, it is transformed from one format to another. An example would be a 1080p file with an average bitrate of 8MB/s. A client may only be able to accept a stream with a maximum quality of 6MB/s. Transcoding creates a temporary copy of your higher bitrate file with one with a lower bitrate, while minimizing a loss in quality. This setting influences the quality used when transcoding media. We definitely recommend leaving this set to the default <b>Automatic</b> value.</p>
        <p><b>Background transcoding x264 preset</b>
        </p>
        <p>You can control the preset used by the transcoder when processing content for background transcoding (Mobile Sync, Cloud Sync, or Media Optimizer). This setting creates new versions of your media in various formats if you find that your Plex Media Server clients are using a particular transcoding settting frequently. An example would be, your media is stored at 4k resolution but your clients normally transcode to 1080p. You can pre-transode your media into that format, which releaves much of the strain on your CPU when streaming.</p>
        <p><b>Maximum simultaneous video transcode</b>
        </p>
        <p>Choose how many transcoding sessions you will allow simultaneously. Most users won’t see a need to change this value. That being said, if you have a particaularly slow internet connection from your Plex Media Server to the internet, limiting the number of users may be required, as does upping this limit if your client streams warrant it.</p>
