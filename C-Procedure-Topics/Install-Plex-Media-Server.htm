7.	After a few seconds you’ll be prompted to sign in with the credentials you created in Step 1. <img src="../Resources/Images/06. Sign in with your Plex.tv credentials.png" /></p>
        <p>
















 
8.	After signing in, Plex will open a browser to your own Plex Media Server!  The initial screens provide some information about how the server works.  You’ll notice the browser is directing you to URL 127.0.0.1, which tells your computer that it is hosting the webpage.  Click GOT IT! 

 
                  Figure 9. Click GOT IT! to proceed.<img src="../Resources/Images/07. PMS Intro Screens.png" /></p>

        <p>10.	Untick the box marked Allow me to access my media outside my home.

        <p>11.	Steps 11a-d will add media from your computer to Plex’s content library.  If your Windows Music, Photos, or Videos folder contain content, Plex will normally choose them for you.  You can remove them by clicking the red x at the end of the content library’s name.  If you don’t want to share any other media click next.	<img src="../Resources/Images/09.
